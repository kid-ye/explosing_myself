            <h1>Goodbye to all shitty ads</h1>
            <img src="./img/shitty-ads-2.webp" alt="">
                <p>If you're tired of seeing all these annoying ads on the internet, I've got you covered.</p>
                <p>
                <h2>The Problem:</h2>
                <p>Try logging into YouTube without an ad blocker today, and you'll be bombarded with thousands of ads. Many of these are scams. Here are some common types of YouTube ads:</p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                Skippable Video Ads
                <br>
                Non-Skippable Video Ads
                <br>
                Bumper Ads
                <br>
                Overlay Ads
                <br>
                Display Ads
                <br>
                Mid-Roll Ads
                <br>
                Sponsored Cards
                <br>
                YouTube Shorts Ad
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>All of these can be incredibly frustrating. It's not just YouTube; the same issue occurs on many websites.</p>
                <h2>How to Overcome This Ad-War:</h2>
                <h2>Step 1: Switch to Firefox</h2>
                <p>If you're using Chrome, consider switching. Chrome recently removed support for powerful ad blockers like uBlock Origin. <br>
                    Here's an easy way to shift to Firefox.  <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/switching-chrome-firefox">Switching from Chrome to Firefox</a>
                    <br>
                    While there are other browsers you can try, most of them are either Chrome-based, loaded with unnecessary features that slow them down (bloated), or still in early development. Firefox is, in my opinion, the best choice.</p>
                <h2>Step 2: Customize Firefox to Block Ads</h2>
                <p>Get uBlock Origin: This extension removes most ads on the internet. <br>
                    Download it here: <a href="https://ublockorigin.com/">uBlock Origin</a>(Note: Not available on Chrome)
                    <br>
                    Get SponsorBlock: This extension removes integrated ads and sponsored segments on YouTube videos. <br>Download it here: <a href="https://sponsor.ajay.app/">SponsorBlock</a></p>
                    <h2>Step 3: Troubleshoot Any Remaining Issues</h2>
                <p>If you still encounter ads or pop-ups, you can easily find a solution:

                    Search for the specific problem and add "Reddit" at the end of your query. Most of the time, you'll find the exact solution.
    
                    By following these steps, you can enjoy an ad-free browsing experience!</p>
